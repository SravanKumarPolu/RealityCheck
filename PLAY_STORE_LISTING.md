## Long Description

### Version 1: Problem-First Approach (Recommended)

**Tired of regretting the same decisions?** Late-night purchases, saying yes when you should say no, taking on projects that drain you?

RealityCheck is different. **Most apps let you reflect on the past. We help you predict the future better.**

**How it works:**
• **Before you act** – Make a quick prediction (5-10 seconds): What will this decision do to your energy, mood, stress, and regret?
• **Get a reminder** – We'll nudge you to reality-check what actually happened
• **See the difference** – Compare your predictions vs reality side-by-side
• **Discover patterns** – "You're overconfident in Money decisions" or "You underestimate late-night screens' impact on mood"

**What you get:**
✓ **Decision Accuracy Score** (0-100%) – Track your prediction skill like a fitness tracker
✓ **Regret Map** – See which categories cause the most regret
✓ **Miscalibration alerts** – Learn where your intuition lies to you
✓ **Actionable insights** – "Repeated regret: Saying yes to extra work when tired"

**Perfect for:**
• Students who regret late-night binges or impulse purchases
• Professionals making career decisions (projects, job moves, courses)
• Anyone who wants to make better decisions through data

**Why RealityCheck?**
We're not another mood tracker. We're a **decision gym** where you train your intuition with measurable feedback. Log decisions in 5-10 seconds. See patterns over weeks. Reduce regret through better predictions.

*Local storage only. Your data stays on your device.*

**⏰ Smart Reminders**

• **Decision Accuracy Score** – Track your prediction accuracy over time (0-100%)
• **Regret Map** – Visual breakdown of regret by category
• See where your intuition is accurate – and where it lies to you

**🎯 Perfect For**
• Students tracking late-night decisions, purchases, study habits
• Professionals making career choices, project decisions, learning investments
• Anyone wanting to reduce regret through better decision-making

**💡 Why RealityCheck?**
Most decision apps are backward-looking diaries. RealityCheck is forward-looking: you predict, we track reality, you learn. Build your Decision Accuracy Score like a skill. See patterns. Make better choices.
